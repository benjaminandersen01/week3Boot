# week3Boot
The goal for this week is to create responsive layout that is ready to receive data next next. The page will have certain components set on it (header, footer, hero image, etc). You will also create 3 different layouts for the blog posts; large, medium, and small.

 

Create a bootstrap page with the following components (can re-use the in-class layout)
navbar
brand
2/3 links
dropdown item
hero image
background image
h1 centered
p centered
4/8 column
4  unit column
icon of a person (something like this (Links to an external site.))
centered paragraph of text
8 unit column
h2 centered 
left justified paragraph
HTML input with a width of col-8  and a button with "Submit" as the text
sticky footer w/ text in it
In addition to that layout (most of which was done in class), we want to develop three layouts for a blog post:

Large
Medium
Small
